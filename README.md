# N-gram frequencies in a list of text files

This is a NUMA MapReduce framework that I created for my final assignment for CS 4414: Systems Programming.

It  distributes tasks over multiple threads and uses C++ templates to compute n-gram (a sequence of exactly n words in some single sentence) frequencies in a list of text files.
